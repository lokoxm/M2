# Narco Life RPG
Generated and managed by Amazon Q Developer

Build **Narco Life RPG**, a text-based online open-world RPG web app...
Build a functional foundation for an online text-based open-world RPG web app.
Players start as low-level criminals in Mexico or the U.S. and progress by completing missions, trading goods, and upgrading skills to rise in the criminal hierarchy. Gameplay mixes strategy, management, and role-playing elements, emphasizing meaningful choices and progression.
	The project must be architected cleanly, with modular, reusable code and proper documentation ‚Äî as if written by a senior full-stack engineer leading a professional development team.	‚öôÔ∏è Technology Stack
		‚Ä¢	Frontend: React + Vite + TailwindCSS
	‚Ä¢	Backend: Node.js + Express
	‚Ä¢	Database: AWS DynamoDB
	‚Ä¢	Authentication: AWS Cognito
	‚Ä¢	Hosting: AWS Amplify
	‚Ä¢	Server Logic: AWS Lambda Functions
	‚Ä¢	Optional AI Expansion: Amazon Bedrock (for procedural missions and NPC dialogue later)	üß© Core Features
	1. Authentication & Player Management
		‚Ä¢	AWS Cognito handles login, registration, and logout.
	‚Ä¢	Each user can create up to 3 characters.
	‚Ä¢	Store all player data (stats, skills, inventory, money, XP) in DynamoDB.
	2. Main Menu (Game Hub)
		‚Ä¢	After login, display a dashboard showing:
	‚Ä¢	Player name, level, cash, XP, stamina, health.
	‚Ä¢	Buttons leading to:
	‚Ä¢	Travel Map
	‚Ä¢	Missions
	‚Ä¢	Streets
	‚Ä¢	Inventory
	‚Ä¢	Skill Tree
	‚Ä¢	Character List
	‚Ä¢	Logout
	3. Travel Map
		‚Ä¢	Two regions: Mexico (Tijuana, Juarez, Puerto Vallarta) and U.S. (Los Angeles, Miami, New York).
	‚Ä¢	Traveling costs money and stamina.
	‚Ä¢	Each city has unique NPCs and missions.
	4. Missions
		‚Ä¢	10 starter missions stored in DynamoDB.
	‚Ä¢	Each mission includes:
	‚Ä¢	Title, description, difficulty, requirements, rewards (cash + XP).
	‚Ä¢	Mission outcomes determined by skills (Strength, Intelligence, Endurance, Shooting).
	‚Ä¢	Lambda function calculates success, applies rewards, and updates character record.
	5. Streets (Marketplace)
		‚Ä¢	List NPCs who buy/sell items and drugs.
	‚Ä¢	Each NPC has different prices that fluctuate over time.
	‚Ä¢	Allow buying and selling, updating the database instantly.
	6. Inventory System
		‚Ä¢	Display owned items and quantities.
	‚Ä¢	Actions: Use, Sell, Drop.
	‚Ä¢	Dynamic updating of inventory and cash balance.
	7. Skill Tree
		‚Ä¢	Skills: Strength, Intelligence, Endurance, Shooting.
	‚Ä¢	Spend XP to improve skills.
	‚Ä¢	Updated instantly in database and visible in UI.
	8. Character Progression
		‚Ä¢	Level = XP accumulation.
	‚Ä¢	Higher levels unlock harder missions and rarer NPCs.
	‚Ä¢	Auto-save after each main action.	üé® Visual Style & Color Palette
		‚Ä¢	Theme: Gritty, dark urban underworld atmosphere with subtle satire.
	‚Ä¢	Primary Colors:
	‚Ä¢	Charcoal Black #0E0E0E
	‚Ä¢	Deep Gray #1C1C1C
	‚Ä¢	Crimson Red #B30000
	‚Ä¢	Muted Gold #D4AF37
	‚Ä¢	Pale White #EAEAEA
	‚Ä¢	Typography: Bold sans-serif (Montserrat or Oswald).
	‚Ä¢	UI Direction:
	‚Ä¢	Interface inspired by the illustrated, cinematic look of ‚ÄúGrand Theft Auto V‚Äù loading screens ‚Äî vivid colors, heavy shadows, and polished gradients.
	‚Ä¢	Centered dashboard with crisp rectangular buttons.
	‚Ä¢	Soft hover transitions and gradient glows.
	‚Ä¢	Subtle background vignette for depth.
	‚Ä¢	Persistent HUD showing player cash, health, and stamina.	üíæ Example Data Model	üß± Implementation Requirements
		‚Ä¢	Organize folders:
	‚Ä¢	/frontend ‚Üí React + TailwindCSS UI
	‚Ä¢	/backend ‚Üí Express API and Lambda handlers
	‚Ä¢	/infrastructure ‚Üí Amplify configuration
	‚Ä¢	Use async/await for all API operations.
	‚Ä¢	Add meaningful comments above each function (purpose, inputs, outputs).
	‚Ä¢	Include placeholder NPCs, missions, and player data to avoid empty renders.
	‚Ä¢	Apply clean, consistent naming and indentation.
	‚Ä¢	Follow Amplify‚Äôs recommended project structure and CI/CD setup.	‚úÖ Deliverable
	Produce a fully functional prototype that allows users to:
		1.	Register / log in
	2.	Create and manage up to three characters
	3.	View and navigate the main menu
	4.	Travel between cities
	5.	Complete missions (with backend logic and rewards)
	6.	Trade with NPCs
	7.	View inventory and upgrade skills
	The build must be live-ready ‚Äî hosted through AWS Amplify with connected DynamoDB, and the code structured for continuous updates via GitHub.
	After completion, automatically:
		1.	Deploy the app to AWS Amplify.
	2.	Connect the repository to GitHub for version control and CI/CD.
	3.	Generate environment variables for DynamoDB, Cognito, and Lambda connections.	Final Goal:
Deliver a visually appealing, responsive, and functional foundation for Narco Life RPG ‚Äî a browser-based text RPG that feels immersive, fast, and expandable.
Code as if crafting the core framework for a studio-quality game project.
